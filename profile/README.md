# MediSync AI
MediSync AI enables live transcription of conversations between doctors and patients, storing real-time information directly in the electronic patient record. This optimizes efficiency and quality, saving up to 3 working hours daily.

By using our transcription function, medical professionals can seamlessly convert spoken patient information into text. This not only facilitates efficient data entry and documentation but also saves valuable time during patient visits. MediSync AI provides support to doctors in improving their workflows, allowing them to focus more on essential patient care.

After each patient visit, doctors traditionally have to create extensive SOAP notes (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan), which can lead to chronic overload in today's daily operations. Our innovation: MediSync AI enables the generation of written summaries from conversations between doctors and patients.
